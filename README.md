# Housing-Project


This is a project for predicting housing prices using the 1978 Boston housing data set.
The models that were used was the standard linear regression, random forest, SVR, LASSO/Ridge regressor, and XGB.
These models were compared side by side in order to contrast their predictive ability based on their respective R-squared score.
Hyper parameter optimization was done with a grid search algorithm.
