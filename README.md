# Housing-Project


This is a project for predicting housing prices using the 1978 Boston housing data set.
The following models that were used:Standard Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVR, LASSO/Ridge regressor, and XGB.
These models were compared side by side in order to contrast their predictive ability based on their respective R-squared score.
Hyper parameter optimization was done with a grid search algorithm.
